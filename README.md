# Tumbleweed (alpha) ![CI](https://github.com/legacycodehq/tumbleweed/actions/workflows/jvm-tests.yml/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/legacycodehq/tumbleweed)

Understand Kotlin and Java classes with ease ðŸ˜Ž

## Is this for me?

- You have joined a new team or an organization and want to understand the codebase.
- You want to contribute to an open-source project to build your portfolio.
- You want to break down a large class.
- You want to bring a function under test and want to break dependencies and see them in real-time.

## Installation

```bash
brew install legacycodehq/tap/twd
```

## Updates

```bash
brew upgrade twd
```

## Live demo

You can try this [sample interactive graph](https://redgreenio.github.io/) for Signal Android
App's [StoryViewerPageFragment](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/ff8f9ca81ae6a25e1e946612c817206b9410d9a1/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/stories/viewer/page/StoryViewerPageFragment.kt)
class.

## Features

### 1. Class visualization

You must first build the project and then run the tool.

The command will start a web server on port 7070. Go to `localhost:7070` in your browser to see the diagram. The diagram
updates in real-time as you make changes to the source code and compile the project.

For more options, run `twd watch --help`.

#### 1.1 Android support (experimental)

```bash
twd watch -x android MediaPreviewActivity
```

Read [this blog post](https://legacycode.com/android-support) to learn how to use this feature when examining Android
classes.

#### 1.2 Without Android support

```bash
twd watch MediaPreviewActivity
```

### 2. File ownership (experimental)

![Treemap](docs/images/ownership.png)

#### Usage

```bash
twd ownership --repo <path-to-git-repo>
```

The command will start a web server on port 7080. Visit the app on `localhost:7080`.

### 3. Module dependency diagram (experimental)

![PlantUML component diagram](docs/images/modules.png)

#### Usage

```bash
twd modules ~/GitHubProjects/Signal-Android
```

The command will print a Graphviz directed graph DSL.

1. Copy the DSL and paste it into the [online Graphviz tool](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline).
2. The tool selects the **dot** engine by default, for best results use the **circo** engine from the engine dropdown.
