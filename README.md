# Eureka ![CI](https://github.com/legacycodehq/eureka/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/legacycodehq/eureka)

Breakthrough tooling to work with Kotlin and Java codebases üöÄ

## üèéÔ∏è Installation

```bash
brew install legacycodehq/tap/eureka
```

## üéâ Updates

```bash
brew upgrade eureka
```

## Live demo

You can try this [sample interactive graph](https://redgreenio.github.io/) for Signal Android
App's [StoryViewerPageFragment](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/ff8f9ca81ae6a25e1e946612c817206b9410d9a1/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/stories/viewer/page/StoryViewerPageFragment.kt)
class.

## Features

### 1. Class visualization

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** You must first build the project and then run the `watch` subcommand.

The command will start a web server on port 7070. Go to `localhost:7070` in your browser to see the diagram. The diagram
updates in real-time as you make changes to the source code and compile the project.

![Edge bundling graph](docs/images/watch.png)

#### Usage

```bash
eureka watch StoryViewerPageFragment
```

#### Usage (Android, experimental and recommended)

```bash
eureka watch -x android StoryViewerPageFragment
```

Read [this blog post](https://legacycode.com/android-support) to learn how to use the experimental feature when
examining Android classes.

#### Identifying Clusters

Press `Cmd + K` on Mac or `Ctrl + K` on Linux and Windows to open the identify cluster dialog.
This [blog article](https://legacycode.com/large-class-responsibilities/) has
instructions on how to use cluster identification.

For more options, run `eureka watch --help`.

### 2. Class inheritance hierarchy visualization (experimental)

![Class inheritance hierarchy](docs/images/hierarchy.png)

#### Usage (Android)

```bash
eureka hierarchy signal-6.23.3.apk -n androidx.fragment.app.Fragment
```

#### Usage (JVM artifacts)

```bash
eureka hierarchy truth-1.1.5.jar -n com.google.common.truth.Subject
```

Visit `localhost:7090` in your browser to see the diagram.

#### Pruning

Visualizing class hierarchies as trees is a useful way to understand complex structures in software. Sometimes, these
trees can become quite large, making it difficult to find relevant information. To address this, we offer a feature that
allows you to 'prune' these trees by specifying certain keywords.

Pruning in this context means reducing the size of the tree to only include nodes that match the given keyword, or have
descendants that match the keyword. This feature can significantly reduce the complexity of the tree, making it easier
to navigate and understand.

To use this feature, you simply adjust the URL of your tree visualization by providing a prune parameter. For example,

`http://localhost:7090/?class=androidx.fragment.app.Fragment&prune=Payment`

### 3. Routes between screens in an Android app (experimental)

![routes between Fragment and Activity classes](docs/images/flows.png)

#### Usage

```bash
eureka flows wikipedia.apk
```

Visit `localhost:7060` in your browser to see the diagram.

### 4. List files with highest LOC

#### Usage (default, searches Kotlin and Java sources)

```bash
eureka top 10
```

#### Output

```

#### Usage (specify extensions)

```bash
eureka top 10 --ext cpp,swift
```

### 5. File ownership (experimental)

![Treemap](docs/images/ownership.png)

#### Usage

```bash
eureka ownership
```

The command will start a web server on port 7080. Visit the app on `localhost:7080`.

#### Known issues

- Throws exceptions when visiting binary or empty files.

### 6. Module dependency diagram (experimental)

![PlantUML component diagram](docs/images/modules.png)

#### Usage

```bash
eureka modules ~/GitHubProjects/Signal-Android
```

The command will print a Graphviz directed graph DSL.

1. Copy the DSL and paste it into the [online Graphviz tool](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline).
2. The tool selects the **dot** engine by default, for best results use the **circo** engine from the engine dropdown.

## Release a new build

### Credentials (initial setup)

1. Create a `~/.jreleaser/config.properties` file.
2. Add the following properties to the file.

```text
JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>
JRELEASER_HOMEBREW_GITLAB_TOKEN=<token>
```

Where `token` is a GitHub personal access token with `delete:packages`, `repo`, and `write:packages` scopes.

### Releasing

1. If you have multiple JDKs installed, switch to JDK 11.

2. Release,
    - For minor releases, run `./release.sh`
    - For bug fix releases, run `./bug_fix_release.sh`

3. Update changelog
    - Go to the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/LegacyCodeHQ/eureka/releases) page and edit the release notes for
      the latest release.
